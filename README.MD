# My Docs
My Docs manages any kind of documents like bills, certificates or account statements. Simply take photos of your document or use files from your file system, describe your document with tags and categorize it. Optionally you can set a point in time when the document should automatically be deleted. With My Docs you will never lose the overview of your documents again and in any case you need e.g. a bill you will find it immediately.
